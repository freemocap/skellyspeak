/// The fullest layout a one-row bar can show in the room it has.
///
/// A bar lists its layouts from fullest to most compact. Each is a value of
/// the bar's `data-fit` attribute, which the bar's stylesheet reads to drop or
/// shorten parts. The hook tries them in that order and keeps the first under
/// which `overflows` finds nothing cut off; when none fits, the last. Every try
/// happens synchronously before paint, so the bar never shows a layout that
/// does not fit, and it never wraps onto a second row to find room.
///
/// The room is the bar's own, not the window's: a side panel opening or
/// closing changes it as much as a resize does. The bar fits again when it
/// changes size, when its content changes (a counter gains a digit, a name
/// changes, the interface language changes), when the document's appearance
/// changes its spacing or type, and when a font arrives.
